**Link to project:**  [Portfolio](https://nicoledicochea.netlify.app/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned

The original contact form was set up with mail.php but I couldn't get that function to work. I searched for an alternative and came up with Formspree. I changed the contact form action from mail.php to the custom link given through https://formspree.io/. The site works great for sending form submissions directly to my work email!

## Optimizations

I would love to add more projects to the Recent Work Section. I have projects on my github, but I would like to have them displayed on my personal portfolio as well.

##  Examples

Take a look at some of my recent work.
